      <p class="paragraph">
        Hello! I am Sai Kishore(he/him). I am a graduate student at PSU and my
        major is Computer Science. I have almost 3 years of work experience. I
        did an internship for 6 months during my undergrad as a ServiceNow
        Developer and later worked as an Application Systems Engineer -
        ServiceNow Platform for over a period of 2 years. It was a great
        experience being part of ServiceNow platform team, learnt a lot of new
        technologies and methodologies. Enjoyed every bit of my work and would
        love to have ServiceNow development as one of my future career options.
        I'm also interested in UI/UX and web development. Designing beautiful
        web applications fascinates me. At PSU I have taken Full stack web
        development, Operating Systems, Internetworking Protocols, DBMS and
        Algorithm Design and Analysis so far. Few of my academic projects
        include Internet Relay Chat, Full stack photo viewer application and a
        mobile application to detect pot holes on roads using Gyroscope.
