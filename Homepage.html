          Hello! I am Sai Kishore(he/him). I am a graduate student at PSU and my
          major is Computer Science. I have almost 3 years of work experience. I
          did an internship for 6 months during my undergrad as a ServiceNow
          Developer and later worked as an Application Systems Engineer -
          ServiceNow Platform for over a period of 2 years. It was a great
          experience being part of ServiceNow platform team, learnt a lot of new
          technologies and methodologies. Enjoyed every bit of my work and would
          love to have ServiceNow development as one of my future career
          options. I'm also interested in UI/UX and web development. Designing
          beautiful web applications fascinates me. At PSU I have taken Full
          stack web development, Operating Systems, Internetworking Protocols,
          DBMS and Algorithm Design and Analysis so far. Few of my academic
          projects include Internet Relay Chat, Full stack photo viewer
          application and a mobile application to detect pot holes on roads
          using Gyroscope.
